# Mixed Reality Design Labs
This repo is where Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality Design team publishes sample apps and experiments.

# Surfaces
Surfaces is an open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs. It demonstrates how to use **[Mixed Reality Toolkit(MRTK)](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)**'s input system and building blocks to create an app experience for HoloLens 2. In this project, you can find the examples of:
- Use MRTK's **[Input System](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/Input/Overview.html)**, specifically hand / joint tracking.
- Use MRTK's **[Standard Shader](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_MRTKStandardShader.html)** for performant graphics.

You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experiences.

Lunar Module is a open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs, it is a spiritual sequel to the 1979 Atari classic, *Lunar Lander*. This sample app will demonstrate how to extend Hololens' base gestures with two hand tracking and xbox controller input, reactive objects to surface mapping and plane finding, and simple menu systems. You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experience.
